<h2>Climate change relates to major changes in the temperature, 
precipitation, and others of the atmosphere for many years. 
This is due to fossil fuel combustion and deforestation, 
which brings about industrial processes mainly associated with 
human activities that induce global warming, increase in sea levels, 
extreme climate conditions, and a disruption in the ecosystem. 
The need is for adequate global cooperation, innovation in sources 
of renewable energy, and appropriate practices that reduce the greenhouse 
emissions and address its impacts.</h2>
